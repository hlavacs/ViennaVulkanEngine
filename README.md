# The Vienna Vulkan Engine (VVE)
The Vienna Vulkan Engine (VVVE) is a Vulkan based render engine meant for learning and teaching the Vulkan API. It is open source under the MIT license. The VVE has been started as basis for game based courses at the Faculty of Computer Science of the University of Vienna, held by Prof. Helmut Hlavacs:

- https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=052214&semester=2019W
- https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=052212&semester=2019W
- https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=052211&semester=2019S

VVE's main contributor is Prof. Helmut Hlavacs (http://entertain.univie.ac.at/~hlavacs/). However, VVE will be heavily involved in the aforementioned courses, and other courses as well, and many students are already working on VVE extensions, porting, debugging etc.

VVE features are:
- 100% Vulkan, C++11, 14, 17, no templates
- Windowing through GLFW, other systems are possible.
- Multiplatform (almost) out of the box: Win 10, Linux, MacOS (using MoltenVK). See instructions below.
- Separation between the engine itself and an independent Vulkan helper layer below. The engine usually does not call Vulkan functions directly, but rather only helper functions, acting like macros. This reduces complexity.
- Simple callback usage through event listeners.
- Uses several OSS libraries and  - if-possible - single-header libraries for loading assets, multithreading, etc.
- Windowing through GLFW, other window systems are possible.
- Documentation with Doxygen

- Uses AMD's VMA Library for memory allocation.


# Set up for Windows 10

Clone the project, open the .sln file, compile, run.
For Windows 10, all non-Vulkan dependencies are in the external directory. The Vulkan SDK is supposed to be pointed at by the VULKAN_SDK environment variable.

The project will be updated regularly, so it makes sense to download the source files once in a while, or clone the whole project. Make sure to keep your main.cpp or other files that you created.


# Set up environment for Ubuntu 18.04 (Thanks to Lukas Walisch)

dependencies:

- Vulkan SDK, GLFW, Assimp

https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment#page_Linux
Follow the tutorial to install Vulkan and GLFW. At the end the header files and the libraries from Vulkan and GLFW should be in the path.

- Assimp

```
sudo apt install libassimp-dev
```

- GLM

```
sudo apt install libglm-dev
```

- stb_image.h
Download the file from https://github.com/nothings/stb. No compilation required. Just put the stb_image.h file in the path (e.g. `mv stb_image.h /usr/local/include`)

- GLI
Download the library from https://github.com/g-truc/gli. IMPORTANT: Download from the master branch, NOT the latest release. Extract the directory, open a terminal in the downloaded directory and compile the library with
```
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```

## Run the project
All whats left is to run the project using cmake. Open a terminal in the project root and build the executable
```
cmake .
make
```

and run the executable with
```
./vienna_vulkan_engine_cmake
```

## Development
Info: I use the CLion IDE for developing. It is a minimal effort to set up the project as CLion only needs a CmakeLists.txt file which already exists. If you add new source files, be sure to add them to CmakeLists.txt. Debugging with breakpoints is possible.



# Vienna Vulkan Engine macOS Instructions (Thanks to Emanuel Stadler)

## Import project from GitHub
-	To import the project from git into Xcode, follow the steps described in this Stack Overflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50728567/841052
-	When adding folders to Xcode using drag and drop, select “Copy items if needed” and select “Create groups”.
-	The external folder and the VulkanEngine folder need to be added to Xcode
-	The VulkanSDK folder can be deleted in Xcode, as we are using the macOS SDK

## Set up Xcode
-	We follow the steps described on https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment#page_MacOS
-	Download the Vulkan SDK
-	Install glfw3, glm and assimp using brew install (Homebrew is at: https://brew.sh)
-	Set up the Header Search Paths and Library search paths as described in the tutorial
-	Add the external directory to the Header Search Paths and select recursive
-	Add the glfw3, libassimp and libvulkan libraries in the Build Phases to Link Binary With Libraries as described in the tutorial
-	If you want to debug shaders, include the Metal framework in Link Binary With Libraries
-	Add the .cpp files from the project to the “Compile Sources” Build Phase
-	Add the environment variables as described in the tutorial (Edit Scheme)
-	In Edit Scheme > Options, use custom working directory and select the directory “VulkanEngine”

## Source Code
-	You might need to edit VHHelper.h lines 37 and 38 (stb) to use quotes instead of angled brackets.s
-	You might need to download the current version of gli-master from the master branch on https://github.com/g-truc/gli and replace the version in the external directory or alternatively change line 81 in gli/core/bc.inl from uint_t Channel1 to uint8_t Channel1 (see also https://github.com/g-truc/gli/issues/154)
Building and running
-	In main.cpp on line 165 set mve(true) to mve(false) to disable debugging and the validation layers, otherwise the engine does not work.
-	The project should now build and run on macOS, you might need to clean your build folder before building.

# Vulkan Video Encode

The preprocessor define `VULKAN_VIDEO_ENCODE` enables an extension to encode the output as video. It is using the Vulkan Video Extensions for hardware accelerated encoding. The used codec is H.264. The 2 necessary Vulkan extensions `VK_KHR_video_encode_queue` and `VK_KHR_video_encode_h264` are released with Vulkan 1.3.274 as revisions:
- VK_KHR_video_encode_queue: rev. 12
- VK_KHR_video_encode_h264: rev. 14

There is no official Vulkan SDK containing this Vulkan revision released yet. The header files can be downloaded from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers/tags and combined with another SDK.
The only graphics driver supporting those extensions at the moment is the NVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver available at https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver. According https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-encode AMD and Intel will follow soon.

The code is tested with
- Windows 11
- NVIDIA RTX 3070
- Vulkan SDK 1.3.268.0 + Vulkan-Headers-1.3.275
- NVIDIA driver version 538.09 (Vulkan Beta Driver)

After enabling `Write Frames` in the GUI the output is written to the file `hwenc.264` (in the current directory). It can be played with VLC or ffplay.
