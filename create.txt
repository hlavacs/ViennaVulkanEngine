Create a script into file build_manual.cmd that does the same as cmake would do. 
download all necessary projects into directory build/_deps, compile them using cmake 
and then compile the main project. 
let the user choose between release and debug, and between MSVC and MSVC Clang as command line parameters.
Always show the progress. Compile SDL3, SDL3_mixer, assimp and vkbootstrap with cmake. 
Compile the main project with the chosen compiler, progressive. Only compile those files that
need compilation. Compile the main project and also the examples.
